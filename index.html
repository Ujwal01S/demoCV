        <h1>This is 1st heading </h1>
        <p>
            I am using tag p here for paragraph. We can make headings from h1 to h6. The priority of heading keeps getting lower as we start going from h1 to h6 i.e the letters keep getting smaller and smaller
        </p>
        <p>
            This is 2nd paragraph.There are two types of tags: i) that needs closing tag. ii) self closing tag.
            Tags contain attributes inorder to implement attributes we write attributes after tag with space. Different tags support different attributes.
            We can find the attributes the tags can support by seeing in website Decdocs.io.
